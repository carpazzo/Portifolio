            Some about me.
          </h1>

          <p>
            My name is Dalton Ramiro, I'm 34 years old and I come from Brazil. I've
            been living in Ã–stersund since 2012, with my wife and 2 children. I
            left Brazil back in 2008, first I moved to Australia so I could
            learn English, also because I had a passion for the place. Who
            wouldn't Sydney is a beautiful place full of atractions, wonderful
            beachs and a place with different cultural backgrounds. For the last
            11 years i been working within the fitness industrie. I started
            back in 2005 when I got my first job as a Life Saver. By that time I
            had started my Physical Education Degree but it all started to change
            in 2006 when i was offered a position as a Gym instructor in a local
            but small gym by the time. I really enjoyed that work and I had the
            chance to put in practice all that I was learning in the University.
            But something was not completed, inside me I had another desire,
            even though I had passion for what I was doing I also had passion for
            something else. I'm being a computer user since I was 12 years old,
            always had the passion and interest how it worked. So I tried to
            become a computer engineer around 2003 and I failed on that attempt
            due my lack of commitment and responsibility. even that i failed
            there, it never left me, and around September of 2017 that desire
            started to grow and I decide to get back on the trail. Now being an
            adult was easier to find focus and motivation to try even harder,
            and I took my chance to get back in that area. Now I can dedicate my time
            wisely and effectively to help myself to achieve something for my
            future.
